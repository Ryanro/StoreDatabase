This is my first time to create a website by using the JSP and MySQL. In this tutorial you will learn how to create a website and make it to connect with your database. And ensure stynchronous updates of data. And I also record the screen to make sure you can understand the operation process of it. It has been able to meet most of the needs. I also divide it into two parts through the user's identity. One can operate the goods message(Count Number:lizechen1 password:123456), and the other can operate the employees message and can  keep track of theirs' attendance(Count Number:lizechen2 password:123456). 
And then, everything will be perfected by using the new techniques which I've not learned. So, you can stay focus on this project if you are a green hand like me ! haha!
